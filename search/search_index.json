You can also search the item by typing the name in the field for a quicker selection.</p> <ul> <li> <p>The Data Model is the data source that contains the field you wish to use in the formula. Data models are listed in alphabetical order.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Field is the field you wish to use in the formula. Fields are listed in alphabetical order.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Operator determines the type of aggregation that should be performed on the selected field. </p> <p>Note</p> <p>The Dynamic List operator creates a list that can be dynamically updated depending on the filters used.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Click Add Filter to add a filter to the formula. The Add Group feature allows for grouping filters and transferring them to the newly created group by dragging the handle bar . Groups can be a part of other groups and configured between OR and AND. For formula examples, see Workbook Formula Examples.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Select the Filter field, operator and value. </p> <ul> <li> <p>The Field is the field you wish to use in the filter.

If the formula is incorrect, a message will be displayed. When resolving the formula, a timeout occurs when the query takes 300 seconds (5 minutes) or when the data results retrieved for the formula exceed 500,000 entries.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click Save.</p> <p></p> </li> </ol> <p>Note</p> <p>If the content of a referenced cell is modified, all formulas referencing the cell will be automatically recalculated. </p> <p></p> <p>The Formula Wizard generates a function in the workbook that is visible in the formula bar. When clicking the formula bar, the NECFORMULA function (which is similar to the NECACCESS function in the Excel Add-in) appears in a pop-up window.</p> <p></p> <p>Note</p> <p>As opposed to Excel Add-in, you do not need to create a reference configuration. Thanks to smart caching, configuration is done automatically based on the formula created.</p> </li> <li> <p>When using more than one NECFORMULA within a cell, the Formula Wizard allows you to assign names to each formula.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Select a cell with multiple NECFORMULA, then click Formula Wizard from the Analysis tab.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the list on the left, click the  to rename the NECFORMULA of your choice.</p> <p> </p> </li> <li> <p>Once changes are saved, custom names are added to the NECFORMULA in the cell.</p> <p></p> </li> </ol> <p>Note</p> <p>This feature only appears when there are multiple formulas within a single cell.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you wish to use a global variable or a global selection page variable, click Functions from the Analysis tab.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Select a variable from the Global Variable or Global Selection Page Parameters list.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click Save.
